## Last Week's Accomplishments
>crawled across the back-end implimentation of LATE and developed a refrence .txt file to build my understanding

>I was not able to actualy commit code to the repository for the allocating alorithm
> > LATE is not at the point where the algorithm could recieve or display its results

>but, I posted a page to the wiki detailing the algorithm and complexity therof to be used in late as well as specific modifications to the algorithm pertaining to LATE; priority, finite containers, and due dates
> > this is to both get my thoughts down and out to everyone about the details of LATE's core behavior

## This Week's Plan

> research and develop prototypes for the notification system or tackle the bug where an error message appears in production mode

## Anything Blocking?

> focus has been shifting to the S.P.A overhaul
>unsure of what exactly I need/can to do

## Notes

> not much, im starting to build steam with familiarity with late
