## Last Week's Accomplishments

>Gain functional working knowledge of Node.js blocking and non blocking functions as well as working familiarity with the http and fs standard modules for Node.js

>Gained working knowledge of the Koa 3rd paty module

>Essentialy Im getting onto my feet finaly from knowing nothing.

## This Week's Plan

>Finish MongoDB learning

>impliment the FFD heuristic algorithm for LATE, making use of the blocks of time we established in the schemas

## Anything Blocking?

>HW6 in dataStructures will be drawing a large amount of my time away from time on LATE, unfortunately

>Hopefully I will be able to at least impliment the core algorithm sans the back and forth between the database and the program

## Notes

> N/A I have 0 knowledge on the general practices of backend development so even though im begining to approach some semblence of competency with the tools we have decided, I still don't have the expeirence so im gonna be fairly slow in making a polished functioning feature.
