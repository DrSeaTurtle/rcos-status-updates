## Last Week's Accomplishments

> research completed, there is no universal method for pushing notifications to a phone that doesnt burn data
>using respective methods for ios and android would draw resources we shouldn't allocate to it

## This Week's Plan

> make a page on late that is just a front for the implimentation of the algorithm
>no memory of the past, knowledge of the future, etc
