## Last Week's Accomplishments

I finally got the core algorithm for late's allocator working.
It functions in the abstract, meaning it only considers the relevent info(deadlines, priority,etc)


## This Week's Plan

The next step is to create a program that takes in a certain users schedule and assignments
proccesses them into the object format needed, and pipes it into the algorithm

## Anything Blocking?

My understanding of how to pull from the server has waned since i stopped focusing on it, will need a refresher


## Notes

> I am going to be more on top of these updates now
