>Things done last week
  I reviewd the changes made to LATE's design and 
  realised that the core of the algorithm used for allocation didnt accomodate deadlines at all
>Things I will be doing this week
  rewriting the abstract portion of the algorithm to represent and respect an asssignmenst deadline
  This also gives me an excuse to make a fresh pass at it, since exception handling was also non-existant
>Blockers
  I have a calcII test  on wendesday and my focs and econ both have a test next week, as well as Comporg's HW being due that week as well
